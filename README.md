# asset-libraries

Structure libraries shared in Beautiful Atoms' community. 

Proposal for Batoms' asset library
-----------------------------------------------------

- Include an integrated structures library with common crystals and molecules. All structures are annotated, indexed,  with previews and ready for immediate load and reuse. 

- User can add their own asset, group structures into folders and search assets by tags.

- User can share their asset in Batoms' community.


Here is a preview of Batoms' asset library.
